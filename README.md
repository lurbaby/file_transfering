# file_transfering
This is quick way to send or receive files via python socket module. Why u should use it ? This is 
secure method to send and receive files with no using websites or messengers, it is realy hard to detect the
input signal.

if you want send files :
   1. download client.py in directory with your files , which u want to send.    
   2. change ip, port variables (server.py - must open ports). 
   3. open client.py and type name of file.



if you want to receive files: 
   1. download server.py.
   2. you need to open ports (you can use programs as ngrok).
   3. when u opened the ports send it to client which want send files.
